
Crop Yield Prediction

This project predicts crop yield using a deep learning model and deploys it with FastAPI for real-time forecasting. It leverages categorical embeddings (Region, Soil, Crop, Weather) and scaled numeric features (Rainfall, Temperature, Fertilizer, Irrigation, Days to Harvest) to deliver accurate predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Hybrid deep learning model with embeddings + dense layers

Encodes categorical and numeric agricultural factors

Real-time prediction API powered by FastAPI

Interactive Swagger UI at /docs

Scalable and reusable for agricultural research

ðŸ“ˆ Example Output
{
  "predicted_value": 6.23,
  "crop_features": {
    "Region": "North",
    "Soil_Type": "Loam",
    "Crop": "Barley",

ðŸ“Š Model Results

The model was trained with early stopping and evaluated on both training and test sets.

Train MAE: 0.40

Train MSE: 0.25

Train RÂ²: 0.91

Test MAE: 0.40

Test MSE: 0.25

âœ… These results show the model generalizes well, with high accuracy and minimal error.

ðŸŒ± Use Cases

Farmers can forecast yield in advance for better planning

Agricultural researchers can analyze the impact of soil & weather conditions

Policymakers can optimize resource allocation and food supply planning

âœ¨ This project highlights how AI in agriculture can transform farming decisions with real-time, data-driven insights.
